\section{Introduction}
LaTeX has been the gold standard for scientific typesetting for decades. Recently, the advent of WebAssembly (WASM) has enabled the migration of these heavy-duty desktop applications to the web. Our platform utilizes the latest TeX Live 2025 distribution, providing over 4,000 packages and the most stable pdfTeX kernel to date. 

One of the key features of this sample is the seamless resolution of cross-references and bibliography. When a user edits the \texttt{.bib} file, the system automatically triggers a BibTeX run followed by necessary recompilations.
